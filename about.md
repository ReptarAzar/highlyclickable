<div class="about">

Inspired by a few well-intentioned product managers saying things like – well, just make sure you make it <span class="hc"> highly clickable</span> – we made a game that made things harder to click by hiding the cursor when you move the mouse. :)
      we hope you enjoy it. If you have any feedback, feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=reptarazar&text=Highly%20Clickable">tweet at @ReptarAzar</a>
